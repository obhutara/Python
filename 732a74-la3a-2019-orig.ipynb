    "The point of Object-oriented Programming is to support encapsulation and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle without things getting out of hand. Often, software architects (those high-level programmers who are responsible for how large systems are designed on a technical level) talk about Object-oriented design or Object-oriented analysis. The point of this is to identify the necessary _objects_ in a system. An object in this sense is not exactly the same as a Python object but rather a somewhat higher level logical unit which can reasonably be thought of as an independent component within the system. These high level objects might then be further subdivided into smaller and smaller objects and at a some level the responsibility shifts from the system architect to the team or individual developer working on a specific component. Thus, Object-oriented thinking is necessary for anyone developing code which will be integrated with a larger system, for instance a data scientist implementing analytics tools."

    "Python implements the Object-oriented paradigm to a somewhat larger degree than the Functional paradigm. However, there are features considered necessary for _strict_ object-oriented programming missing from Python. Mainly, we are talking about data protection. Not in a software security sense, but in the sense of encapsulation. There is no simple way to strictly control access to member variables in Python. This does not affect this lab in any way but is worth remembering if one has worked in a language such as Java previously."
